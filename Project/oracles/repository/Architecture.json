        "description": "Most GMs and players aren't equipped with an elaborate architectural vocabulary for describing every feature of a civilization's buildings. To begin, it's easier to just pick a few evocative adjectives to describe the structures and work out from there. The rural village might be described as a mass of squat adobe buildings or a collection of slim, tall wooden structures perched up above flood-prone land. The details of the architecture will usually bend to accommodate the special features of the climate and terrain. For extra complexity, you can roll several times but take only one word from each list to create a new set."

Even when brick or stone is available, the nobles of a society might prefer grand wooden manors adorned with elaborate carvings for their seats of power. There's usually some reason behind such choices, whether because the alternate materials are inferior in some way, uncomfortable to live in, lacking in skilled craftsmen, or impractical for the climate. In the Latter Earth, some societies might use salvaged ancient materials that are very strange."

Most societies are obliged to work with the hues that nature gives them cheaply, and sometimes those are restricted. In other cases, certain colors or patterns may have cultural or religious significance, and wearing them is a matter of cultural meaning rather than personal aesthetic tastes. It's a commonplace for certain colors to bear special meaning in a society, either being reserved for certain castes or social roles, or indicative of qualities such as good luck, death, fertility, or good health."

In other cases, however, these motifs impart significant information about political alliances, religious devotion, or familial ties. The use of certain motifs and sigils might be reserved to certain buildings or people in a society."

The motifs listed here might be executed in a simple way on humble homes, but grand structures could express them in truly grand style."

Private residences may echo this favoritism with smaller edifices scaled for private use and enjoyment, whether that consists of a townhouse's walled back garden or the fortified exterior face of a rural manor house."

A few even base their communities on ritually-significant patterns or mandalas, requiring that all construction fit with the greater divine plan.
